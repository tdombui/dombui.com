### abstract
The original goal of this project was to provide a simple image hosting platform for my own photographic work, without having to depend on traditional image sharing platforms such as the small-formatted Instagram, once-a-day dose of BeReal, the aging Tumblr, and the costly Flickr — as efficient, service-rich, and popular these platforms are, dombui.com originally intended to surpass the limitations of these platforms; limitations such as Instagram's maximum res of 1080 x 1350, and 'liberate my work' from the limitations of these platforms.

The Web is a medium — like canvas, paper, etc. — and dombui.com is my medium. With dombui.com, my work is no longer overshadowed by things like advertising and subscriptions, and is freely expressed.
